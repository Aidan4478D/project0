          In the VEX Robotics Competition, presented by the Robotics Education & Competition Foundation,
          teams of students are tasked with designing and building a robot to play against other teams in
          a game-based engineering challenge. Classroom STEM concepts are put to the test as students learn
          lifelong skills in teamwork, leadership, communications, and more. Tournaments are held year-round
          at the regional, state, and national levels and culminate at the VEX Robotics World Championship
          each April!

          VEX Robotics Competition Change Up is played on a 12’x12’ square field configured as seen below. Two
          (2) Alliances - one (1) “red” and one (1) “blue” - composed of two (2) Teams each, compete in Matches
          consisting of a fifteen second (0:15) Autonomous Period, followed by a one minute and forty-five
          second (1:45) Driver Controlled Period.
